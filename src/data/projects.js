This spacious house of almost 600 square metres includes a basement with sauna and gym, two living floors and an attic floor with cinema and billiard room.

    The result is a cosy, modern and family-oriented interior. It has a somewhat eclectic style, combining elements of modern classics with plinths and mouldings on the walls, oriental inserts in the form of carved columns from Samarkand (Uzbekistan) and stylish high-tech.

    Each room has its own character and creates a specific mood. The dining room, for example, is designed for family gatherings and can accommodate a very large family. It has a seating area right on the windowsills, adding to the cosiness and comfort.

    In the stairwell, you'll be greeted by a carved column that recalls the courtyard of a 'caravanserai'. Tiles, paintings, colour schemes and furniture in the interior give it a sunny warmth and oriental cosiness. On the attic floor, for example, you'll find low sofas reminiscent of oriental (couch) 'tapchan'.

    Special attention has been given to creating light and gentle children's rooms for the three daughters. They have become the perfect place to play and relax, reflecting the individuality of each of the girls.

    We invite you to take the plunge into this unique interior, where different styles are reunited and comfort and joy is created for the whole family.`,
