              Hi! My name is Ivan Morozov. <br />I am a visual designer of
              interiors and small (architectural) forms. <br />
              Many people don't understand the drawings or can't imagine what
              their future interior will look like as a whole, I'm ready to
              help.
            </p>

            <FaArrowCircleDown
              className={s.scroll_doun}
              onClick={scrollToNextSection}
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Let me tell you more about my experience:
            <br />I have quite a lot of experience in design, graphics,
            rendering and modelling 3D models and interiors and exteriors.
            Collaborative experience with fellow architects and designers.
            <br /> I work in programs such as 3D max + (Corona, V-ray), Adobe
            Photoshop, Corel-Draw.
            <br /> In 2006 I graduated from the architectural university "KRSU"
            in Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek.
            <br /> - After graduation I worked as an interior designer in a
            private capacity (design, furniture of flats, houses and
            restaurants).
            <br />
            - I worked at IND achitects from 2010-2014 where he gained good
            experience in visualisation, cooperation with partners and
            manufacturers of finishing materials, as well as experience in
            working with clients.
            <br /> When IND achitects moved to Moscow I was lucky enough to work
            there as well, where I had more opportunities and funds to carry out
            interesting projects (flats, houses, restaurants and food courts).
            <br />
            -I am currently living with my family in DÃ¼sseldorf and have had
            time to work as a designer for Balter GmbH and Avaloid GmbH from
            2016-2021.
            <br />
            My tasks have included: creating product visualisations for website
            and advertising, packaging design, promotional materials, 3D
            mock-ups of exhibition halls and office space design.
            <br /> -Also working as a freelancer, as a as a visual designer. I
            actively work with architects and other designers.
            <br /> This work really interests me and is very close to my heart.
            It is especially gratifying when the visualisation is brought to
            life.
            <br />I firmly believe in my abilities and motivation to create
            interesting projects.
